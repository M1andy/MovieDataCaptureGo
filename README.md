# MovieDataCaptureGo

This project is inspired by [MovieDataCapture](https://github.com/yoshiko2/Movie_Data_Capture), 
which is a quite helpful tool when you need to organize your movie library.
But the origin project is quite slow when the library is big as its programming language is python.

So I started this project, trying to use golang to rebuild the tool.
I'm still learning golang and colly the crawler framework, so there may be quite a lot of mistakes.

## TODO 

- [X] config loader
- [X] elegant logger
- [X] glob videos function
- [ ] video information crawler
- [ ] NFO generator
- [ ] and other things...
